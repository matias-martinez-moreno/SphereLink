##  Git Workflow

**Flow:** `development` → `feature-branch` → `merge` → `development`

1.  **Sync with `development`**
    ```bash
    git checkout development
    git pull origin development
    ```

2.  **Create Feature Branch**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

3.  **Commit Changes**
    ```bash
    # After making changes
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Short description of the feature"
    ```

4.  **Sync Branch Before Merging**
    ```bash
    git checkout development
    git pull origin development
    git checkout feature/your-feature-name
    git merge development
    ```
    *(Resolve any conflicts if they appear)*

5.  **Merge into `development`**
    ```bash
    git checkout development
    git merge feature/your-feature-name
    ```

6.  **Push to Remote**
    ```bash
    git push origin development
    ```

7.  **Delete Local Branch (Optional)**
    ```bash
    git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
    ```

## Managing Dependencies

To ensure all team members use the same package versions, follow this process when adding a new dependency.

1.  **Install the New Package**
    ```bash
    pip install new-package-name
    ```

2.  **Update the `requirements.txt` File**
    This command saves all current packages and their exact versions to the file.
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Commit the `requirements.txt` File**
    Add the updated `requirements.txt` file to your commit. This ensures everyone on the team will install the new dependency when they set up the project or pull the latest changes.
